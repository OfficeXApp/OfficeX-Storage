# Developer To Do

- [x] Upload file & connect hard drive
- [x] Query indexdb('DriveDB') at every page with query config in the url params
- [ ] Replace the mock files with real indexdb files
- [ ] Fix the owner on uploaded files and folders
- [ ] Refactor folder upload to not depend on connect hard drive
- [ ] Store upload queue observables in hook, so we can show observable progress from anywhere below <DriveProvider>
